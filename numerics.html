      <h1>Small Changes, Big Impacts</h1>
    
    <ul>
      
        <li>Decrease the length of your shower and the temperature of the water </li>
          <ul>
            <li>A 10 minute shower uses around 25 gallons of water and emits around 5 kg of CO2 if heated by electricity or 1.5 kg of CO2 if heated by natural gas</li>
            <li>Over a year, this could save 547.5 -1825 kg of CO2 depending on the efficiency of the heating mechanism</li>
          </ul>
        <li> Turn off lights when you leave the room and use natural light during the day
          <ul>
            <li>A typical 60-watt light bulb emits around 0.03 kg of CO2 per hour if the electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels
              Reduce heating and invest in good insulation and heating systems</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Reduce heating and invest in good insulation and heating systems</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Every degree Fahrenheit temperature reduction saves about 3% on your heating bill and reduces your carbon footprint by around 0.4 kg of CO2 per day.  </li>
            <li>Over the winter season, this could save around 36.5 kg of CO2</li>

          </ul>
          <li> Air-dry clothes (and clean the lint filter) </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Each load of laundry that you air-dry instead can save around 0.6 kg of CO2 emissions </li>
            <li> Over the course of a year, this could save around 30 kg of CO2 </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Drive less and either bike or use public transport when possible </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Each mile driven emits approximately 0.36 kg of CO2. Reducing your driving by 10 miles per week would save 3.6 kg of CO2 per week or around 189 kg of CO2 per year. </li>

  
          </ul>
