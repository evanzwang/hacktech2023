EvergreenConnect is a website/app (proposed for HackTech 2023) that tracks aspects of your sustainability from utilities, consumption, and donations. This is all summarized within a succinct metric, the "sustainability score," in order to easily compare with friends and people all over the world.

With the addition of a social aspect, we aim to incentivize individuals to value choosing sustainable actions through friendly competition.

## Prototype
